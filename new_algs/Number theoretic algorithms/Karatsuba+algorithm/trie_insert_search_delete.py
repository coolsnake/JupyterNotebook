# Description:
# Implement prefix trie and perform all basic operations - Insert, Search and
# Delete.
#
# Approach:
# Each node of trie can have max supported alphabets children so we can have a
# array of 26(if only small case chars) whose index can be mapped to 26
# characters. Also we take a flag to store if this node marks an end of word or
# not.
#
# Insert
# ------
# Check if node exist or not, follow its children for next characters in trie
# otherwise add a new node to trie to accommodate new word. When all chars are
# inserted in trie for a word, mark is_end_of_word as True.
#
# Search
# ------
# Similar to insert operation, when we have found whole word, check if end of
# word is set or not, if set whole word exist in trie otherwise not.
#
# Delete
# ------
# Recursive approach followed and nodes deleted in bottom up manner. Lot of
# cases to be handled, explained in delete() below.
#
# Reference:
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-delete/
#
# Complexity:
# Space to store trie - O(ALPHABET_SET*L*N)
# Insert - O(L)
# Search - O(L)
# Delete - O(L)
#
# ALPHABET_SET - Size of alphabet set, 26 if trie has all lower case chars
# N - Number of words in trie
# L - Length of a word
#
# Limitation:
# This trie is useful in searching words separated with delimeter like
# dictionary where each word is independent of each other. In cases where full
# text search is required in a document this is not useful. We can use suffix
# tries for that.
#
# Another problem is lot of memory is wasted in tries(in suffix tris also), to
# reduce that, we can use compressed tries.
