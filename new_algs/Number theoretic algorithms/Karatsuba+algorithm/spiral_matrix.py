# Description:
# Given a number N, form a matrix having numbers from 1 to N*N in spiral form.
# N = 3
# 1 2 3
# 8 9 4
# 7 6 5
#
# N = 4
# 01 02 03 04
# 12 13 14 05
# 11 16 15 06
# 10 09 08 07
#
# Approach:
# We know that sequence of direction will be:
# 1. Left to right: row constant, col increasing
# 2. Top to down: row decreasing, col constant
# 3. Right to left: row constant, col decreasing
# 4. Down to top: row decreasing, col constant
#
# So using above fact we can take 2 list indicating row/col directions and
# compute new row, col. If row/col is not valid, we can use next direction.
#
# This can also be done used 4 loops for 4 directions like this:
# https://github.com/hansrajdas/algorithms/blob/master/Level-3/print_matrix_in_spiral.py
#
# Complexity:
# O(N^2)

  dc = [1, 0, -1, 0]  # Column direction sequence
  val = 0
  direction = 0  # 0 to 3, indicating 4 directions
  
  # Create empty matrix
  for r in range(n):
    matrix.append([0] * n)
    
  while val < n * n:
    val += 1
    matrix[row][col] = val
    row += dr[direction]
    col += dc[direction]
    
    # If new row, col is invalid(out of bound or already used), revert previous
    # row, col and change direction.
