# Description:
# Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing
# programs. That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of
# colors), a point and a new color, fill in the surrounding area (having same
# color) until the color changes from original color.
# In other words, screen is clicked at pixel where its BLUE and we have selected
# new color as RED then all the surrounding area having BLUE color should be
# changed with RED.
#
# Approach:
# Let clicked at pixel r, c and has color BLUE and we want to update with RED.
# Recursively checked the adjacent pixels up, down, left and right if it has
# BLUE then updated with RED otherwise left as it was.
#
# Can also be solved using breadth first search where each pixel would be a node
# and row - 1, row + 1, col - 1 and col + 1 will be edges.
#
# Complexity:
# O(2^r * 2^c), r and c are rows and columns of matrix.
