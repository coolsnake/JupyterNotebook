# Description:
# Find longest palindrome from a given string. If input string is:
# forgeeksskeegfor, output should be: geeksskeeg as this is length longest(10)
# palindrome in given string.
#
# Approach:
# Checked all combinations. Considered all characters as middle one and tried
# to find as long palindrome as possible by expanding towards both left and
# right side.
#
# Complexity:
# O(n^2)
#
# Note:
# There is another approach called Manacherâ€™s Algorithm which finds longest
# palindrome in O(n) time and O(n) space.

  # Consider all characters as middle one and find around them for longest
  # palindrome.

    # Check for even length of palindromes.
    low = i - 1
    high = i
    while (low >= 0 and high < n) and (string[low] == string[high]):
      if max_len < high - low + 1:
        max_len = high - low + 1
        start = low
      low -= 1
      high += 1
