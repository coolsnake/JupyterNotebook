# Description:
# Bellman ford can be used to find shortest path from a source to all reachable
# vertexes. Graph can have both positive and negative weights and cycles.
#
# Implementation:
# - Relax all edges |V| -1 times as there can be max of |V| -1 edges in any
#   simple path(from source any vertex in graph).
# - If there is a negative weight cycle then it reports and marks shortest
#   distance as undefined.
#
# Reference:
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-23-bellman-ford-algorithm/
# 
# Complexity: O(VE)
