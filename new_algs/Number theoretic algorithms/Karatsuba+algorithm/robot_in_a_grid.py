# Description:
# Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c
# columns. The robot can only move in 2 directions right and down, but certain
# are "off limits" such that robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to
# find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
#
# Approach:
# Backtracking technique is used. To find a path from the origin, we just work
# backwards. Starting from the last cell, we try to find a path to each of its
# adjacent cells and recurse till starting point.
#
# Complexity:
# O(rc) where r = rows, c = columns
# Without using cache it will be 2^(r+c)
