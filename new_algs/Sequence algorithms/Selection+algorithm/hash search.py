#i would recommend you to read algorithm and data structure before messing with hashtable
# http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/Hashing.html
#this script features the hash function described in the book, which is mod eleven %11
#we apply hash function to all the values in a given list
#we shall obtain the output value for each element
#and assuming this is a perfect hash function
#each value from the list should have a unique hash value
#we can create a dictionary based on the unique hash value
#and assign all the values from the list into dictionary
#when we wanna search for something
#we just need to apply hash function to the target
#and make query on the dictionary for that particular hash value
#O(1), simple AF, not really...
#we could encounter the same hash value for different values from the list
#this is so called hash collision
#there are three ways of solving hash collision in the book
#which are chaining, linear probing and quadratic probing
#lets deliberately create an imperfect hash function to see how it goes


#hash chaining
#the easiest one
#basically stack all the collision together
#form a list under that hash value
#does it make search easier?
#not really, if the list under one hash value gets too large
#it would slow down the search
#the good thing about this method is that you always have all the values in the dictionary
#for other methods, you either have to increase hash table size or drop values


#the first function is to create a dictionary
#assign values from the list to the dictionary based on hash value
def genr_hash(raw_list):

#linear probing
#when collision occurs, we try to find the next empty slot to store it
#it sounds reasonable but it is also trouble

#or we can reset the hash function or expand the dictionary
#in the best case, it is faster than chaining
#in the worst case, it is slower
